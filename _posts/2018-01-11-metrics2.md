I suggest you to go through [metrics](https://channabasavagola.github.io/2018-01-09-metrics/) as much of the content will be continuation from there.

## Classification metrics

*Soft predictions/labels*: These are the probability values that a classifier output. This vector will be of size equal to number of classes.
*Hard predictions/labels*: But usually classifier will be asked to come up with a label that a particular object belongs to.
This is hard prediction. This can be done in two ways and the choice depends upon the task/problem.
- arg max function f(x): Where you predict the label with the max soft prediction.
- threshold: [f(x) > b], you predict a certain label for the soft prediction values above/below threshold.
