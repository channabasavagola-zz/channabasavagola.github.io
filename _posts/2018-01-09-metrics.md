Metric is a measure to the effectiveness of a model. Effectiveness of a model depends on the problem type and is unique. So metric is different for all kinds of problems.

- **MSE**: Measures average/mean squared error of our predictions. At each point, calculate the squared difference between predictions and target and average those values over the objects.

What if we do not use the features to predict target values? What if we predict the same value for all the objects? Now the optimal value that reduces the MSE is the mean value of the target column. This is the baseline model.

To illustrate, consider the following target values:
```python
In [7]: pd.DataFrame([5, 9, 8, 6, 27], columns = ['y'])
Out[7]: 
    y
0   5
1   9
2   8
3   6
4  27
```
To build a baseline model, we should find that one constant value which we predict irrespective of the parameters or features. It is (55/5) 11.
